# Exploatry Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of understanding, summarizing, and visualizing data before applying any machine learning or statistical models.
It helps you discover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and prepare the data for modeling.

### key steps in EDA
1.Understand the dataset

2.Data cleaning

3.Descriptive data analysis

4.Univariate Analysis

5.Bivariate Analysis

6.Multivariate Analysis

7.outlier Detection

8.feature corelations

### Common EDA Visualizations
