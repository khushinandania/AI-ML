# Underfitting & Overfitting

This notebook explains the concepts of underfitting and overfitting in Machine Learning using practical examples and visualizations.
It demonstrates how model complexity affects performance on training and testing data.


### Concepts Covered
##### Underfitting

Model is too simple

Fails to capture data patterns

High error on both training and testing data

##### Overfitting

Model is too complex

Learns noise in the data

Very low training error but high testing error
